    "In the following example, `FileWithLogging` is implemented, where a `File` object is passed as unique attribute; i.e., `FileWithLoging` is the decorator and it keeps a reference to the object it decorates: `File`. Then, the API of `File` is re-implemented inside `FileWithLogging` by adding extra logging functionalities. In that process, `File` is not really modified, but we build a wrapper around it.\n",
