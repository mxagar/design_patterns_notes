# Notes on Design Patterns

I created this repository while following the Udemy course

[Design Patterns in Modern C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/patterns-cplusplus/)

by Dmitri Nesteruk, and the following popular books:

- "Design Patterns" (Addison Wesley), by Gamma, Helm, Johnson & Vlissides
- "Design Patterns" (O'Reailly Head First), by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates

The file `DesignPatterns_Guide.md` contains all th enotes I made; additionally, there is a folder for each of the patterns with specific material.
