# Notes on Design Patterns

This guide and its related files were created while following the Udemy course

[Design Patterns in Modern C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/patterns-cplusplus/)

by Dmitri Nesteruk, and the following popular books:

- "Design Patterns" (Addison Wesley), by Gamma, Helm, Johnson & Vlissides
- "Design Patterns" (O'Reailly Head First), by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates

The file `DesignPatterns_Guide.md` contains all the notes I made; look in the co-located folders for specific pattern code.

I found a repository by Dmitri Nesteruk, which I forked

- [https://github.com/mxagar/DesignPatternsWebinar](https://github.com/mxagar/DesignPatternsWebinar)
- [https://github.com/nesteruk/DesignPatternsWebinar](https://github.com/nesteruk/DesignPatternsWebinar)

However, the current repository builds up on that one and re-structures the complete code. However, note that the original example code is by Dmitri Nesteruk.
