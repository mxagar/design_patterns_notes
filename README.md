# Notes on Design Patterns

This guide and its related files were created while following the Udemy courses

- [Design Patterns in Modern C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/patterns-cplusplus/)
- [Design Patterns in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-python/)

by Dmitri Nesteruk.

I found a repository by Dmitri Nesteruk, which I forked

- [https://github.com/mxagar/DesignPatternsWebinar](https://github.com/mxagar/DesignPatternsWebinar)
- [https://github.com/nesteruk/DesignPatternsWebinar](https://github.com/nesteruk/DesignPatternsWebinar)

However, the current repository builds up on that one and re-structures the complete code. Nevertheless, note that the original example code is by Dmitri Nesteruk.

In addition to the aforementioned courses, I also used the following resources:

- "Design Patterns" (Addison Wesley), by Gamma, Helm, Johnson & Vlissides (The Gang of Four)
- "Design Patterns" (O'Reailly Head First), by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates
- [Python Design Patterns, by Brandon Rhodes](https://python-patterns.guide/)

The notes are divided into the following documents:

- [DesignPatterns_SOLID.md](DesignPatterns_SOLID.md)
- ...
