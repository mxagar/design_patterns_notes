    "Software components are often built with hierarchical relationships. Those relationships can capture resposibility, similarly as it can happen in a company (CEO, manager, employee). The pattern Chain of Responsibility is a chain of components in which all get a change to process a command or a query, optionally having a default processing implementation and an ability to terminate the processing chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, Chain of Responsibility allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until the request is handled. This pattern decouples the sender of the request from the receiver by giving multiple objects a chance to handle the request.\n",
    " \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a GUI, we click a graphical element on a form\n",
    "  - The button handles the action, which leads to stopping the processing\n",
    "  - Or the underlying group box can handle it\n",
    "  - Or the underlying window can handle it\n",
    "- A card computer game\n",
    "  - A creature has attack and defense skills\n",
    "  - Thos skills can be boosted by other card creatures\n",
    "- Support\n",
    "  - We can have first-level or basic support\n",
    "  - Or second-level = advanced support\n",
    "  - Or third-level = expert support\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key components that often appear in Chain of Responsibility are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handler**: Defines an interface for handling requests and for setting the next handler in the chain.\n",
    "- **ConcreteHandler**: Implements the Handler interface and processes requests it is responsible for. If it can't handle the request, it forwards the request to the next handler in the chain.\n",
    "- **Client**: Initiates the request and passes it to the first handler in the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Command and Query Separation (CQS)**: Whenever we operate on objects, we separate all the invokations into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Command: invokation which asks for an action or a change; e.g., set value to X.\n",
    "- Query: ask/retrieve information without changing anything, e.g., get value of X.\n",
    "\n",
    "Separating both Commands and Queries is known as the Command and Query Separation (CQS) Principle. It is a design priciple with some benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clarity: Separating commands and queries makes it clear which methods are performing actions and which are retrieving information.\n",
    "- Simpler Testing: Queries are easier to test because they are idempotent and do not change the state.\n",
    "- Improved Maintainability: Clear separation of responsibilities makes the code easier to understand and maintain."
