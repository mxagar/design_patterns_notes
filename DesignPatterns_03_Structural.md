# Design Patterns: Structural Patterns

This document/guide is the third from a set of 4 documents:

1. SOLID Design Principles
2. Creational Patterns
3. **Structural Patterns**
4. Behavioral Patterns

See the overview file [`README.md`](README.md) for more information on the origin of the guides.

In the present guide, the **Structural Patterns** are defined and examples are given.

Structural patterns deal with the structure of objects:

- Class members, adherence to interfaces, etc.
- Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface.
- Stress the importance of good API design: usability, etc.
