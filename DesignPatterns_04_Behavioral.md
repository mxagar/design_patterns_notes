# Design Patterns: Behavioral Patterns

This document/guide is the fourth from a set of 4 documents:

1. SOLID Design Principles
2. Creational Patterns
3. Structural Patterns
4. **Behavioral Patterns**

See the overview file [`README.md`](README.md) for more information on the origin of the guides.

In the present guide, the **Behavioral Patterns** are defined and examples are given.

Behavioral patterns don't really follow any central theme:

- They are all different.
- Sometimes they overlap in their function, i.e., the goal they achieve, but the underlying mechanisms are different.
